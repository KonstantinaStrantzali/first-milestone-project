## Issues found during site development
    
While I was checking the responsiveness of home page on Firefox Development Tools a space between navbar and  top of the page found. First the bug tried to be fixed by changing the navigation bar *margin* to 0px without any success. After realising that the space kept existing while scrolling accross all the page's content, a video's div found to overlap its containers borders and causing the space due to *margin-left:10%*. The bug fixed when a new container class created and changed the position by setting *display:flex;* and *align-items* and *justify-content* to centre.

<p float="center">
  <img src="md.images/bug-image01.png" width="40%"  height="45%"/>
  <img src="md.images/bug-image02.png" width="55%"/> 
</p>
<br>
<br>
While checking the responsiveness on iPhone 5 viewport, the hamburger menu on navigation bar, found to be pushed down below the other links. The bug fixed when the logo's left and right margin reduced and allowed the burger icon to return back on the top of the page.
<p float="center">
  <img src="md.images/bug-image03.png" width="60%"/>
  <img src="md.images/bug-image04.png" width="80%"/> 
    </p>
<br>
 <br>
Contact form didn't work at the beginning while clicking the submit button without having any field filled. The message "please fill in this field" didn't appear bellow the input elements and contact form didn't respond to any user's movement. The bug fixed when a form element used as a container
    
## Performance testing
    
When I completed the website I run the Google Chrome Developer Tools [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) to test it. The initial rating received for the site's performance was SMTH  due to the large size of the images. 
 <p float="left">
  <img src="md.images/lower-performance (2).png" width="90%" height="80%"/>
  <img src="md.images/Lighthouse-screenshot01.png" width="90%" height="70%"/> 
</p>

For that reason, the images were compressed and uploaded again to Gitpod . The results for the subsequent test were more satisfactory. Some other changes such as shortening of class names, unnecessary external links removal, were made to improve the site's performance. 

    
## Code Validation
I used the following websites to test my code.
[W3C HTML Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) was used to validate the HTML documents.
W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) was used to validate the style.css file. 

    
 - Home page passed [Results](md.images/home-page-validation-results.png)
 - Services page passed [Results](md.images/services-page-validation-results.png)
 - Facilities page passed [Results](md.images/facilities-page-validation-results.png)
 - Contact page passed [Results](md.images/contact-page-validation-results.png)
 - Booking page passed [Results](md.images/booking-page-validation-results.png) 
 - CSS file passed [Results](md.images/CSS-validation-result.png)
